									<h3><b>WHERE WE STORE YOUR DATA</b></h3>
									<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have
										given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access
										certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password
										confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. <br />
				Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent un-authorized access.</p>

										<h3><b>OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING MECHANISMS</b></h3>
										<p>We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other tracking to
											track information about your use of our Website and Services. We may combine
											this information with other personal information we collect from you (and
											our third-party service providers may do so).<br />
											<b>Cookies.</b> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to
											your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping
											purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our
											Website and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in
											process or to allow us to track your activities at our Website and Service.
											There are four types of cookie:<br />
											<b>Strictly necessary cookies.</b> These are cookies that are required for
											the operation of our Website. They include, for example, cookies that enable
											users to log into secure areas of our Website.<br />
											<b>Analytical/performance cookies.</b> These types of cookies allow us to
											recognize, count the number of visitors, and see how visitors move around
											our Website when they are using it. This assists us to improve the way in
											which our Website works, for example, by ensuring that you can find what you
											are looking for easily.<br />
											<b>Functionality cookies.</b> These cookies are used to recognize you when
											you return to our Website. They enable the personalization of content,
											recognition of users, and also remember your user preferences (for example,
											your choice of language or region).<br />
											<b>Targeting cookies.</b> These cookies record your visit to our Website,
											the individual pages visited and the links followed. If the cookie is set by
											a third party (for example, an advertising network) which also monitors
											traffic on other websites, this type of cookie may also be used to track
											your movements across different websites and to create profiles of your
											general online behavior. Information collected by tracking cookies is
											commonly used to target online advertising.<br />
				The four types of cookies above will be either session cookies or persistent cookies.<br />
											<b>Session Cookies.</b> Session cookies exist only during an online session.
											They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off
											your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely
											identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Website or
											Services. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests
											and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our
											Website or Services.<br />
											<b>Persistent Cookies.</b> Persistent cookies remain on your computer after
											you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent
											cookies to remember your user information, preferences and activity, to
											enable us to provide our services to you when you next return to our Website
											or Services. We also use persistent cookies to track aggregate and
											statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with
											other user information. <br />
											<b>Local Storage Objects.</b> We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash
											LSOs") to store your Website preferences and to personalize your visit.
											Flash LSOs are different from browser cookie because of the amount and type
											of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the
											acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on
											Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to
											the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and
											follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer,
											choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to
											review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.<br />
											<b>Storage HTML5 Storage.</b> We may also store your user information and
											Website preferences locally within your web browser via HTML5.<br />
											<b>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</b> Clear GIFs are tiny
											graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In
											contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear
											GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web
											beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Website or Services
											to, among other things, track the activities of Website visitors, help us
											manage content, and compile statistics about Website and Services usage. We
											and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to
											our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our
											emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.<br />
											<b>Changing or Disabling your Cookie Settings.</b> Most web browsers
											automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer you can edit your browser
											options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most
											browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new
											cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie,
											or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Website who disable
											their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the
											Website; however, most site features will not function if you disable
											cookies and you will not be able to login to use our services.<br />
											<b>Do Not Track.</b> Currently, our systems do not honor browser
											“do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as
											discussed above (e.g., by disabling Cookies); you also may opt-out of Third
											Party Analytics or targeted advertising.</p>

										<h3><b>THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS</b></h3>
										<p>We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics,
											Yandex.Metrika and Clicky to evaluate use of our Website and the Services.
											To opt-out of Google Analytics, please go to: <a
												href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptocout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.
											Please note that if you use a new or different computer, install a new
											browser, or clear your cookies; in that case, you will need to re-opt-out
											through the link above.
								</b>
								We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences.
								These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their
								services. These third parties may collect your device ID, IP address, or other
								information about your use of the Services as part of the analytics they provide to us.
							</p>

							<h3><b>THIRD-PARTY AD NETWORKS</b></h3>
							<p>We use third parties, such as network advertisers and other marketing agents, to assist
								us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of
								our advertising campaigns. Network advertisers are third parties that display
								advertisements based on your visits to our Website and unrelated third-party websites.
								This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for
								products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network
								providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies,
								JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to
								measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.
								These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s
								specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with
								information about your use of our Website and our Services, as well as aggregate or
								non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Website and users of our
								Service.
							</b>
							You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the
							Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). For
							more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices
							regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of
							third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective
							websites: <a
								href="www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>
							(NAI) and <a href="www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> (DAA).
						</b>
						Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same)
						only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not
						mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Website or other websites.
						You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that
						you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this
						opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or mobile device
						or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional
						information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites accessible by the above links.</p>

								provision of our Services), or to take steps requested by you before entering into said
								contract;</li>
							<li>the processing is in "Quantum System"’s or someone else’s legitimate interests, and
								these interests are not overridden by your interests or rights in the protection of your
								personal data. This may include internal research and analytics assessments, for

							<a href="mailto:DPO@quantum-system.co">DPO@quantum-system.co</a>.</p>

						<h3><b>DO YOU HAVE TO GIVE US YOUR INFORMATION?</b></h3>
						<p>In most cases, providing your personal data to us is optional, however, if you do not provide
							it, you will not be able to use our Services. For example, we need details such as your
							name, phone number and email details so that we can create yout a broker account, so that
							with its help you would be able to use "Quantum System". In other cases, you have a choice
							over whether we collect your personal data, for example, you can turn off cookies on your
							browser and we will not place any cookies on your device or computer (although in this case
							you may not be able to use all parts of our website). </p>


						<h3><b>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</b></h3>

						<h3><b>EEA CUSTOMERS ONLY: YOUR RIGHTS</b></h3>
						<p>You have several rights in relation to your personal data which are described in more detail
							below. You can exercise your rights at any time by contacting us at <a
								href="mailto:DPO@quantum-system.co">DPO@quantum-system.co</a>.<br />
							<b>Accessing your data</b><br />
				You can ask us to:<br />
				Confirm whether we are processing your personal data<br />
				Give you a copy of that data<br />
				Provide you with other information about your personal data such as what data we have, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we transfer it abroad and how we protect it, how long we keep it for, what rights you have, how you can make a complaint, where we got your data from and whether we carry out any automated decision making or profiling.  We aim to give you all this information in this privacy policy, although if anything is unclear, please contact our Data Protection Officer at
							<a href="mailto:DPO@quantum-system.co">DPO@quantum-system.co</a>.<br />
				You do not have to pay a fee for a copy of your information unless your request is unfounded, respective or excessive, in which case we will charge a reasonable amount in the circumstances.  We will let you know of any charges before completing your request.<br />
				We aim to respond to you within 1 (one) month of receiving your request unless it is particularly complicated or you have made several requests, in which case we aim to respond within 3 (three) months.  We will let you know if we are going to take longer than 1 (one) month in dealing with your request.  If we have a lot of information about you we might ask you if you can tell us what exactly you want to receive.  This will help us action your request more quickly.<br />
							<b>Correcting your data</b><br />
				You can ask us to correct any data which is inaccurate or incomplete.  This is free of charge.<br />
				If we have shared the data with anyone else, we will tell them about the correction wherever possible.  We aim to deal with requests for correction within 1 (one) month, although it might take us up to 3 (three) months if your request is particularly complicated.<br />
				If we cannot action a request to correct your data, we will let you know and explain why this is.<br />
							<b>Erasing your data</b><br />
				This right is sometimes referred to as “the right to be forgotten”.  This is not an absolute right but you have the right to have your data erased, free of charge, in certain circumstances.
							<br />
				You can ask for your data to be erased where:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected or
									processed;</li>
								<li>we are processing your data based on your consent, and you withdraw that consent;
								</li>
								<li>you object to the processing and we do not have an overriding legitimate interest
									for continuing;</li>
								<li>your data has been unlawfully processed;</li>
								<li>your data must be erased to comply with a legal obligation;</li>
								<li>the data was processed to offer information society services to a child.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>There are some exceptions to this right. If one of these applies, we do not have to
								delete the data. <br />

								<b>Restricting the processing of your data</b><br />
				You can ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data in some circumstances, free of charge.  This is not an absolute right.  If processing is restricted we can store the data and retain enough information to make sure the restriction is respected, but we cannot further process your data.<br />
				You can restrict the processing of your personal data in the following cases:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>if you contest the accuracy of your data, we will restrict processing until we
										have made sure the data is accurate;</li>
									<li>if you object to our processing and we are considering this objection;</li>
									<li>if the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase your data;</li>
									<li>if we no longer need the personal data but you require the data to establish,
										exercise or defend a legal claim.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If we have disclosed the data to a third party, we will inform them about the
									restriction unless it is impossible or would require a disproportionate effort. We
									will tell you if we decide to lift a restriction on processing your data.<br />
									<b>Objecting to the processing of your data</b><br />
				Objecting to the processing of your data is free of charge.  It is not an absolute right but you can object to our processing of your data where it is: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>based on the legitimate interests ground; or</li>
										<li>for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>We will stop processing your personal data unless we have compelling legitimate
										grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or unless
										we are processing the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
										claims.<br />
				You can require us to stop using your data for direct marketing purposes.  We will stop as soon as we receive your request.  There are no exemptions or reasons for us to refuse.<br />
										<b>Data Portability</b><br />
				This allows you to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services.  It applies where the following conditions are met:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>you provided the personal data to us yourself;</li>
											<li>we are processing the data either based on your consent or because it is
												necessary for the performance of a contract; and</li>
											<li>the processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
